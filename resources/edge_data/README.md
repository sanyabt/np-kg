### Purpose
The first step in constructing a knowledge graph is to build edge lists. In the current build of PheKnowLator (**[`v2.0.0`](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/wiki/v2.0.0)**), this requires downloading and using several sources of linked open data (see Wiki page referenced above for additional information on each source). 

<br>

_OUTPUT:_ Running this step will output a `json` file to `resources/Master_Edge_List_Dict.json`. The structure of this file is shown below:

```python
master_edges = {'chemical-disease'  :
                {'source_labels'    : ';MESH_;',
                 'data_type'        : 'class-class',
                 'edge_relation'    : 'RO_0002606',
                 'uri'              : ('http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/',
                                       'http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/'),
                 'delimiter'        : '#',
                 'column_idx'       : '1;4',
                 'identifier_maps'  : '0:./MESH_CHEBI_MAP.txt;1:disease-dbxref-map',
                 'evidence_criteria': "5;!=;' ",
                 'filter_criteria'  : 'None',
                 'edge_list'        : ["CHEBI_81395", "DOID_12858"],
                                      ["CHEBI_81395", "DOID_0090103"], ...,
                                      ["CHEBI_81395", "DOID_0090104"]}
```

ðŸ›‘ *<b>ASSUMPTIONS</b>* ðŸ›‘  
**The algorithm makes the following assumptions:**
- All downloaded data sources are listed, with metadata, in the [`edge_source_metadata.txt`](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/blob/master/resources/edge_data/edge_source_metadata.txt) document.  
- Any data preprocessing, including the development of identifier mapping and evidence/filtering data, has been 
  completed prior to building the edge lists. A Jupyter Notebook containing examples of different preprocessing 
  steps can be found [`here`](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/blob/master/notebooks/Data_Preparation.ipynb).

### Updates

**Issue:** CTD now has a CAPTCHA is place to prevent automatic downloading of data. This impacts the current build as there is no solution currently in place to work around this.

**Temporary Workaround:** All CTD data sources need to be manually downloaded to the `resources/edge_data` repo prior to running the download step of the build. The downloaded file also needs to be unzipped and have the edge type label appended to the front of the file name (example below).

<br>

**File:** `edge_source_list.txt` 
```bash
chemical-disease, http://ctdbase.org/reports/CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv.gz
chemical-gene, http://ctdbase.org/reports/CTD_chem_gene_ixns.tsv.gz
chemical-phenotype, http://ctdbase.org/reports/CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv.gz
chemical-protein, http://ctdbase.org/reports/CTD_chem_gene_ixns.tsv.gz
```

**Repository:** `resources/edge_data/` 
chemical-disease_CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv
chemical-gene_CTD_chem_gene_ixns.tsv
chemical-phenotype_CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv
chemical-protein_CTD_chem_gene_ixns.tsv
